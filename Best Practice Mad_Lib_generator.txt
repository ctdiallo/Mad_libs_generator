## Assignment 3: Mad Lib Ibiza
"""
Inspired by Summer Son’s Mad Libs project with Javascript. 
The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs. 
For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc. Then, once all the 
information has been inputted, the program will take that data and 
place them into a premade story template. You’ll need prompts for 
user input, and to then print out the full story at the end with 
the input included.
"""

## Concepts to keep in mind: 
"""
Strings 
Variables 
Concatenation 
Print Deliverables
"""
"""
A pretty fun beginning project that gets you thinking about how to manipulate user inputted data. 
Compared to the prior projects, this project focuses far more on strings and concatenating. 
Have some fun coming up with some wacky stories for this!
"""

## 1 Understating of the problem
"""
I should setup many inputs that will be placed at specific places in the story. 
These can be: Noun, place, number, adverb, food, adj, verb...
Inputs should look like this noun = , adj = input("enter an adjective: )
once inputs ready these should be inserted in the right place in the text.
"""

## 2 What's the plan?
"""
1/ Have the whole story ready
2/ Take bits and set them as inputs. inp1 = inp2....
3/ Create gaps in the text according to inputs
4/ Create the variables and inputs
4/ Start each sentence with print. 
5/ Set a cool closing sentence
"""


## 3 Declare inputs
"""
verb : went
adverb: pleasantly
noun: landscape
adjective: balmy
dj: Black Coffee
temperature (°C): 30
verb: create

Was fine
improvement ideas: loop to repeat the exercice, isdigit for the temperature, print all lines together
